        "url": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260204114643.htm",
        "reason": "This finding offers a nuanced and crucial insight into climate change feedback loops. It reveals that increased ice melt, often presumed to boost ocean carbon absorption through iron fertilization, does not automatically lead to greater algae growth due to the form of iron. This challenges a simplistic understanding of ocean's role in climate regulation and suggests that Antarctic ice loss could potentially reduce the ocean's capacity to mitigate climate change, a significant development in understanding global climate dynamics."
